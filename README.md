This a backend for the stock app. The front end of this app was created in react and the repo path for that is : 
https://github.com/aussenrist15/stock-app

# How to run both together?

Its very simple. Just download both projects on your pc or clone them. Save everything on your computer in the following format:

Main Folder : 
-> client (folder)
-> All the files from this project

# Note:

The client folder contains the React project files.
